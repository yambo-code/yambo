1) Removing symmetries I get

1s> PPs rotation |########################################| [100%] --(E) --(X)
 <01s> [08] Game OverAt line 149 of file section.f90 (unit = 11, file = '�w�3')
Fortran runtime error: File '' does not exist

but the code works


2) when using only 1 valence and 1 conduction some time 
if I restart I get 

<---> Covariant Dipoles: |                                        | [000%] --(E) --(X)

[ERROR] STOP signal received while in :[04.02] Messaging
[ERROR]Matrix Ops. driver [GETRF (SI)]:workspace failed

to be checked and verified

======
After merge of 01/2017:

3) In SC object ELECTRICAL?

4) collinear spin pol does not work anymore in NL 

5) damping substituted with FWHM for ext_field

6) SEGFAULT: when using openmp, allocatable already allocated
