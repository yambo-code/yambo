-----------------------
OVERALL philosophy
-----------------------

- dedicated subroutines which interfaces lapack or magma (single and double precision version), and serial or parallel (?)
  
  SERIAL_HERMITIAN_diagonalization            --> could be renamed HEEV
  SERIAL_diagonalization (non hermitian case) --> could be renamed GEEV ?
  SERIAL_inversion
  SERIAL_SVD_inversion
  SERIAL_lin_system (to be merge also with SERIAL_lin_system_gpu)
  
  PARALLEL_HERMITIAN_diagonalization            --> could be merged with SERIAL_HERMITIAN_diagonalization 
  PARALLEL_diagonalization (non hermitian case) --> could be merged with SERIAL_diagonalization

  PARALLEL_MbyM could be created (for now it does not exist)

  The kind of operation could be managed via an handle, however the sobroutines must be cleaned by all extra operations, e.g.
  allocation, parallel setup, etc ... which should be shifted inside LINEAR_ALGEBRA_init or similar subroutine

  LINEAR_ALGEBRA_driver is never directly called, but the above subroutines are directly called. It only performs initializations


-----------------------
DONE
-----------------------

- compilation to be fixed

- To be removed:
    M_eigenvalues, heev and geev interfaces 

- mod_wrapper --> wrapper yambo for single and double to blas --> when available calls devxlib single and double subroutines

- mod_linear algebra has wrappers single and double to few selected lapack
  --> LU_factorization
  --> SV_decomposition
