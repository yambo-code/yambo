## Yambo
This is the distribution of the Yambo code.
Yambo doesn't stand for anything like "Yet Another Many-Body cOde", for instance.  Unless you really want it to. 

## Installation
Quick installation instructions for the impatient:
`./configure [options]`
` make all`
"make" alone prints a list of acceptable targets. Binaries go in bin/.
